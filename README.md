A software developer/enthusiast.

I've always been interested in computer graphics and game development. 

Some of my recent side projects:

- A tool for making/recording blackboard animations videos (https://rasma.app).
- Bringing back the opensourced strategy game 'Tribal Trouble' and hosting its multiplayer server (http://tribaltrouble.org).
